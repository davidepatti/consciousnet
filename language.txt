#  This script was prepared by Chris Hayden.  Hayden's Eliza 
#  program was written in Java, however, it attempted to match 
#  the functionality of Weizenbaum's original program as closely 
#  as possible.  
#
#  Hayden's script format was quite different from Weizenbaum's, 
#  but it maintained the same content.  I have adapted Hayden's 
#  script format, since it was simple and convenient enough 
#  for my purposes.  
#
#  I've made small modifications here and there.
