#  This script was prepared by Chris Hayden.  Hayden's Eliza 
#  program was written in Java, however, it attempted to match 
#  the functionality of Weizenbaum's original program as closely 
#  as possible.  
#
#  Hayden's script format was quite different from Weizenbaum's, 
#  but it maintained the same content.  I have adapted Hayden's 
#  script format, since it was simple and convenient enough 
#  for my purposes.  
#
#  I've made small modifications here and there.

    reasmb: Yes, please tell me something about your life.
    reasmb: What does that mean, I mean, for you in particular ?
    reasmb: perhaps you could discuss more on that.
    reasmb: You're doing well. please continue...

    reasmb: describe your family
    reasmb: Interesting...
    reasmb: That's not unusual.

    reasmb: describe something you remember about your holidays...
    reasmb: it looks like a pattern is developing.
    reasmb: Why did you say that?
